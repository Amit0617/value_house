### What is this? Explain

It is a marketplace of NFTs where anyone can mint and buy NFTs.

### What problems does this solve?
1. It gives you a easy interface to mint your NFTs as a creator.\n
2. You don't have to even think about Smart contracts and Ipfs pinning etc.
3. Right now it is on Mumbai testnet of [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/).

### Why does Polygon matters?
In short, it reduces time and gas fee(a lot) for every transaction. That's it.

### Why shoud I care?
Don't care. Get left behind. Get retarded.
